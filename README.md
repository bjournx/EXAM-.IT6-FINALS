Activity: Building a CRUD REST API with MySQL, Testing, and XML/JSON Output
In this hands-on activity, you will be creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API for a MySQL database. The
API will allow users to interact with a specific table in the database. You will also set up tests to ensure the functionality
of the API, and provide the option to format the API output as XML or JSON based on a URI parameter.
